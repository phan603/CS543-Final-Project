CS 543 Final project - historical footage upscaling

Old film and historical footage often exist in low resolutions, such as 360p or 480p, with compression artifacts, flicker, and frame jitter. Recent deep learning models, such as BasicVSR++, achieve high quantitative accuracy on synthetic datasets, but lose performance on real-world, low resolution videos due to degradations arising from compression, motion blur, and noise. According to the research paper “A Survey of Deep Learning Video Super-Resolution” by Baniya et al., bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world VSR still remains one of the major challenges in the field.
